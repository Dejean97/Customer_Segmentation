# Customer_Segmentation

This project (brief description)

Inspiration for this project came from the [The AI University](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv6Uw36LRbYnX4HDxKPguKg) Youtube channel.

The data used for this project is the online retail [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/).

## Project Summary


### Data Cleaning/Exploration


### Recency, Frequency & Monetary (RFM) Modelling

RFM segmentation is a great method to identify groups of customers for special treatment. A detailed description and step by step methodology can be found on this Optimove [post](https://www.optimove.com/resources/learning-center/rfm-segmentation).


### K-Means Clustering

### Roundup

This project allowed me to learn new skills in python as well as new analytical methods (RFM modelling and K-Means clustering). I believe customer segmentation is a very valuable and applicable skills and I expect to utilise these in my next project which will be an end-to-end analytics consulting task.
